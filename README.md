# profile_demo_app

This project was created to showcase a small app that allows the user to create an account and login with it.

> **_⚠️WARNING:_**  Can't run the app without the Firebase config file. If you really really want to run it, let me know and I'll send it over.

## Features I've worked on:

If you want to see more demo apps, then check out my [Bored App](https://github.com/FrogMustang/BoredApp), [TodosApp](https://github.com/FrogMustang/TodosApp) and my other demo repos (the code is a bit outdated for this one) - [Flutter Demo Apps](https://github.com/FrogMustang/flutter_demo_apps)


## Purpose
The purpose of the app was to implement a nice design from FIgma and integrate Firebase auth login with Email/password. That's why most of the buttons are just for display.

## Challenges
Had a bit of a struggle to create the testing environment with Firebase auth and GetIt, but nothing too serious.

## How to run
I suggest using [FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation) to run the app using Flutter 3.22.0 for the best experience.

## Can't build the project?
If you don't have the environment to run the code, here is a video and some screenshots of what it looks like:
